# 11-critter-caretaker-2.0

Create your own version of the critter_caretaker.py program by defining you won class of critter (zerg, puppies, dragons, whatever you want). Also allow the user to specify how much food they feed the critter and how long they play with the critter. Have these values affect how quickly the critter's hunger and boredom levels drop.


Must include:<br>
1. correct file naming convention
2. proper header
3. wait for the user before exiting the program
4. working code
    * I shouldn't see the word 'critter', just your new thing
    * user specified food and play
    * user values affect hunger and boredom levels
