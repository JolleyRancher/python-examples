# 09-character-creator

Write a character creator program for a role-playing game. The player should be given a pool of 65 points to spend on 6 attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Wisdom, Intelligence, and Charisma. The player should be able to spend points from an attribute and put them back into the pool. Have a check in your program so that the player can't draw more points than are left in the pool or subtract more points than are in an attribute. The 6 attributes and their values should be in a dictionary. Also create a main menu from which the character can choose what to do.

Must include:<br>
1. correct file naming convention
2. proper header
3. working code
    * attributes and values in a dictionary
    * 4 main menu options work
    * can't spend more points than in pool
    * can't remove more points than in attribute
    * wait for the user before exiting the program
