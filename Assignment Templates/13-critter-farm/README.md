# 13-critter-farm

You'll be modifying your code from the previous assignment. Modify your code so that instead of taking care of one object, you'll have many. Keep track of all your objects through a list. Instead of requiring the user to care for a single critter, allow them to care for all of them at the same time. Each menu choice should allow the user to preform the action to all of the critters. Give each critter random starting hunger and boredom level to make the game more interesting.


Must include:<br>
1. correct file naming convention
2. proper header
3. wait for the user before exiting the program
4. working code
    * minimum 5 objects, can have the user decide number or decide for them.
    * menu choice allow care of all objects
    * random starting hunger & boredom levels
