# 12-hack-critter-caretaker

You'll be modifying your code from the previous assignment. Create a backdoor that shows the exact values of the object's attributes. Accomplish this by printing the objects when a secret selection, not listed in the main menu, is entered as the user's choice. (you'll need to add a __str__()).


Must include:<br>
1. correct file naming convention
2. proper header
3. wait for the user before exiting the program
4. working code
    * backdoor (secret menu option) works
    * critter attributes displayed
