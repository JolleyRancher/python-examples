# 10-guess-your-number

Write a program similar to 04 Guess My Number, but where the computer and player switch places. The player will pick a number between 1 and 100 that the computer needs to guess. Limit the number of guess the computer gets. Use at least 3 functions (I would suggest functions for instructions, computer guess, and high_low user input). Have some fun and give the computer a personality with its winning or loosing messages. Remember that it is easier to write a program if you think of an algorithm and create pseudocode first.

Must include:<br>
1. correct file naming convention
2. proper header
3. wait for the user before exiting the program
4. working code
    * min 3 functions
    * limited computer tries
    * computer doesn't guess the same number twice

## Example Output
```
Welcome to the Guess Your Number Game!
I am a special mind-reading machine and will guess the number you're thinking of
between 1 and 100 in 6 tries or less. After each guess, tell me if I'm 'high'
or 'low'. If I guess right, let me know by typing 'correct'.
Press the enter key when you're ready to begin.
For guess 1 I'll try 87...
Am I high or low? high
For guess 2 I'll try 6...
Am I high or low? low
For guess 3 I'll try 15...
Am I high or low? high
For guess 4 I'll try 13...
Am I high or low? low
For guess 5 I'll try 14...
Am I high or low? correct

You cannot fool me puny mortal.
I read your mind in 5 tries.

Press the enter key to exit.
