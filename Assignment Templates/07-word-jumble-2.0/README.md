# 07-word-jumble-2.0

Improve the Word Jumble game so that each word is paired with a hint. The player should be able to see the hint if her or she is stuck. Add a scoring system that rewards player who solve a jumble without asking for the hint(can be as simple as a message). You may also change the word list to be whatever you want.

Must include:<br>
1. correct file naming convention
2. proper header
3. working code
    * minimum of 5 words and 5 hints
    * no hint reward
    * hint punishment
    * wait for the user before exiting the program

## Example Output
```

If you are stuck, type 'hint'.
(Press the enter key at the prompt to quit.)

The jumble is: ujmelb

Your guess: jumble
That's it! You guessed it! And you didn't even have to use a hint, good job!
OR...
Your guess: hint

Your guess: jumble
That's it! You guessed it! But you had to use a hint.
